# We cannot directly use 'tarball_location' (from roles/deployer/defaults)
# since it contains a timestamp specific to each run, which means that
# {{ tarball_location }} will refer to a non-existent file with a different
# timestamp to the tarball actually created.
# So strip the timestamp from {{ tarball_location }}, replacing with a '*' to
# create a shell glob to get the actual filename.
# The replace() filter is intended to change
# e.g. 'ardana-0.9.0-rc1-20170901T000000Z.tar' to 'ardana-0.9.0-rc1-*Z.tar'
# (It is not possible to directly reconstruct this glob since the
# definition of tarball_location contains a hardcoded extension).
