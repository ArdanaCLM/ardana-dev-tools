# this is an example release file to be used to show and document variables
# that can be defined to control the version for specific releases.

# release strings will be appended to the product version for ardana when
# overriding the product_release, it's recommended that you ensure the complete
# version will be parsed by python's pkg_resource.parse_version() function
# and subsequent compare with the correct order of precedence
#
# 1.0.0-a < 1.0.0-a1 < 1.0.0-b1 < 1.0.0-rc1 < 1.0.0 < 1.0.0-1 < 1.0.0-2
#
# a | alpha => development builds
# b | beta => beta kits
# rc => release candidates
product_release: "a1"

# patch level defaults to '0', so to allow the same CI job for the product
# stream to be used, to increment the patch release you simply increment the
# version defined for the variable below:
product_version_patch: 0
