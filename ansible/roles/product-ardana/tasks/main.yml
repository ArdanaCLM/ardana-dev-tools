# Includes Ardana product vars globally

# TODO: this needs to be changed once Ansible 2.0 is available since it
# allows use of with_first_found and include which will allow the following
# in the parent main.yml
#
# - include: "{{ product_name }}/{{ item }}"
#   with_first_found:
#     - {{ product_version }}/main.yml
#     - {{ product_stream }}/main.yml
#     - main.yml
#
# This in turn would mean the head of tree defaults would be included
# via 'include-vars' in this file instead of the current hackier.
#
# Should be fixed by BUG-1771
