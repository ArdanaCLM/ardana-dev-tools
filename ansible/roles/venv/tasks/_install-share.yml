# Install extra service files into the virtual environment build directory.
# The directory structure is controlled directly from the layout of the YAML
# in default/main.yml '_services_default'. Example is as follows:
#
# _services_default:
#   nova:
#    sources:
#       nova:
#         - file_a
#         - dir_b
#         - ...
#       oslo.messaging:
#         - file_a
#         - dir_c
#         - ...
#
# The above '_services_default' YAML for the 'nova' components will copy
# any directory recursively and places the content in directoryâ€™s in the
# 'PACKAGE_CONSTANTS.INSTALL_DIR' which will be in the exported nova-<<version>>.tar file.
#
# /PACKAGE_CONSTANTS.INSTALL_DIR/nova/share/nova/file_a
# /PACKAGE_CONSTANTS.INSTALL_DIR/nova/share/nova/dir_b/...
# /PACKAGE_CONSTANTS.INSTALL_DIR/nova/share/nova/...
# /PACKAGE_CONSTANTS.INSTALL_DIR/nova/share/oslo.messaging/file_a
# /PACKAGE_CONSTANTS.INSTALL_DIR/nova/share/oslo.messaging/dir_c/...
# /PACKAGE_CONSTANTS.INSTALL_DIR/nova/share/oslo.messaging/...
