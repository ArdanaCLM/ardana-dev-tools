# Assemble a config/ directory of relative symlinks.
# We want a relative symlink from
#   openstack/my_cloud/config/service/service.conf.j2
# to
#   openstack/ardana/ansible/roles/service/templates/service.conf.j2
# That is:
#   my_cloud/config/service/service.conf.j2 ->
#       ../../../ardana/ansible/roles/service/templates/service.conf.j2
