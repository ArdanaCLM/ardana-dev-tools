  disk-models:
  - name: CONTROLLER-DISKS
    # 3 disk node; first disk holds VG with logical volumes for operating
    # system and openstack services, second disk holds mysql and third
    # disk holds rabbitmq, with no device groups.

    volume-groups:
    # The policy is not to consume 100% of the space of each volume group.
    # 5% should be left free for snapshots and to allow for some flexibility.
    # sda_root is a templated value to align with whatever partition is really used
    # This value is checked in os config and replaced by the partition actually used
    # on sda e.g. sda1 or sda5
